# DL_using_TF
The projects in this repo are a part of my course from UDACITY.
You can check out my blog on the same project for a more detailed understanding : https://pooj124.hashnode.dev/simple-neural-network-celsius-to-fahrenheit-ckol3o5sa04op3js1gf2l70oa

This project is a very basic neural network and anyone starting off or wants to understand the overview of if will benefit from this.
This project is a part of my course " Introduction to TensorFlow for Deep Learning" on UDACITY : https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud187

I used google colab to work on this, you can implement it on google colab otherwise on Jupyter notbook as well. Through google colab I can directly import my code to the Github.
